<h1>Passport</h1>

<p class="rtecenter"><img src="/sites/iss.ku.edu/files/docs/Admitted/passport.jpg" style="height: 427px; width: 300px; padding: 10px;" />&nbsp;</p>
<p class="rtejustify">A passport is a travel document, usually issued by a country's government, that certifies the identity and nationality of its holder for the purpose of international travel. Standard passports contain the holder's name, place and date of birth, photograph, signature, and other identifying information.</p>
<p class="rtejustify">Once you enter the U.S., the important thing to remember about your Passport is to keep it valid at all times. &nbsp;For some of you, you can renew your passport at an embassy or consulate in the U.S., and for others you will have to return home to get it renewed. &nbsp;Always be mindful of the expiration date.</p>

<h1>Student Visa</h1>

<p class="rtecenter"><img alt="" src="/sites/iss.ku.edu/files/docs/Admitted/visa_new.png" style="height: 208px;" /></p>

<p class="rtejustify">A visa is a document issued by the U.S. government, usually at an embassy or consulate outside of the United States. This allows you to present yourself at the Port of Entry and request to be let in.&nbsp; The important thing to remember about your visa is that this is the only immigration document that is OK to expire while you’re here in the U.S.&nbsp; Think of it as a key to get into the country – you need this “key” to get into the U.S.&nbsp; However, if you are in the U.S. with an expired visa and you decide to travel outside the U.S., you will need to renew it in order to come back.</p>

<p class="rtejustify">You must obtain a visa that is appropriate for your intended purpose for entering the U.S. For most students, this will be an F-1 or a J-1 visa. If you intend to be a student, you must not enter the United States with a tourist visa (B-1/B-2) or under any visa waiver program that your country may have with the United States.&nbsp;You will not be permitted to attend school as a tourist. Canadian citizens do not need a visa.</p>

<h2 class="rtejustify">Common Visa Types for Students</h2>

<ul>
	<li>F-1 Visas are for full-time students.</li>
	<li>F-2 Visas are for spouses and children of F-1 visa holders - these are technically called "dependents."</li>
	<li>J-1 Visas are for exchange students.</li>
	<li>J-2 Visas&nbsp;are for spouses and children of J-1 visa holders - these are technically called "dependents."&nbsp;</li>

<h1>I-94 Arrival-Departure Record</h1>

<p><img src="/sites/iss.ku.edu/files/docs/Admitted/i-94.jpg" style="float: left; height: 265px; width: 300px; padding:15px;" /></p>

<p class="rtejustify">&nbsp;Your I-94 tracks your arrival and departures from the U.S. &nbsp;It also says what status you were admitted to and how long you’re able to stay. &nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtejustify">You will get a NEW I-94 with a NEW admission number every time you enter the U.S. &nbsp;You should have the letters “D/S” on your I-94, which mean that you are admitted to the U.S. for the “Duration of Status”, or for as long as you are maintaining status – this is typically the time that it takes for you to complete your degree/program.</p>

<p class="rtejustify">Your I-94 can come in many different forms. The majority of students will have an electronic I-94 like the example shown on the left. &nbsp;However, some may have a small white card stapled into their passport that has the same information as an electronic I-94 (example below). Still others may be in the process of changing their status. &nbsp;In this case, the I-94 would be shown at the bottom of their approval notice. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="" src="/sites/iss.ku.edu/files/docs/Admitted/i94-form.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 204px; float: left; padding:15px;" />&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtejustify">Once you arrive in the U.S. your I-94 Document will be available on the government website. Please print the document once you arrive in the U.S. <strong>Legally, you are required to carry your I-94 (in any of the aforementioned forms) with you at all times.</strong></p>

<h1>I-20 for students in F-1 Status</h1>

<p><img src="/sites/iss.ku.edu/files/docs/Admitted/Screen%20Shot%202016-01-15%20at%2012.23.33%20PM.png" style="float: left; height: 390px; width: 300px;" /></p>

<p class="rtejustify">Think of your I-20 document as a contract. &nbsp;It indicates your basic biographical information, your major and estimated length of study, School Name, SEVIS ID number, and financial information. &nbsp;DO NOT let your I-20 expire – ISS can extend it for a justifiable reason if more time is needed to complete your program of study.</p>

<p class="rtejustify">Your I-20 should always be up-to-date. &nbsp;For example, should your program of study change or your source of finances, a new I-20 with the correct information will be generated. &nbsp;During your time here, you may acquire a number of I-20’s. &nbsp;Do not throw any of them away, rather keep old ones in a safe place.</p>

<h1>DS-2019 for students in J-1 Status</h1>

<p><img src="/sites/iss.ku.edu/files/docs/Admitted/ds2019.jpg" style="float: left; height: 386px; width: 300px;" /></p>

<p class="rtejustify">Think of your DS-2019 document as a contract. It indicates your basic biographical information, your major and length of study, school name, SEVIS ID number, and program sponsor.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="rtejustify">DO NOT let your DS-2019 expire – your program sponsor can extend it for a justifiable reason if more time is needed to complete your program of study.</p>

<p class="rtejustify">Your DS-2019 should always be up-to-date.&nbsp; For example, should your program dates change, a new DS-2019 with the correct information will be generated.</p>
