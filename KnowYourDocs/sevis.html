<div class="accordion_content">
	<p>
		<strong>SEVIS</strong> stands for <strong>Student and Exchange Visitor Information System</strong> This system is used by the U.S. government to collect and maintain information about F and J status international students and their accompanying dependents during their stay in the U.S. All students who have an initial attendance I-20 Form (F-1 students) and most students who have a “begin a new program” DS-2019 Form (J-1 Students) must pay a SEVIS fee to the US government before they can apply for a visa.

<div class="accordion_content">
	<p>Students currently studying in the U.S. usually do not have to pay the fee again. The fee is tied to the SEVIS ID number and as long as the student has maintained status, the SEVIS record can be transferred to KU without the student repaying the fee.</p>

<div class="accordion">How do I pay the fee?</div>
