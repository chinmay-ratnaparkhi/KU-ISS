<div class="accordion">What is an I-20? (For F-1 Students Only)</div>
<div class="accordion_content">
	<p class="rtejustify">Think of your I-20 document as a contract. It indicates your basic biographical information, your major and estimated length of study, School Name, SEVIS ID number, and financial information. DO NOT let your I-20 expire – ISS can extend it for a justifiable reason if more time is needed to complete your program of study.</p>
	<p class="rtejustify">Your I-20 should always be up-to-date. For example, if your program of study changes or your source of finances changes, a new I-20 with the correct information will be generated. During your time here, you may acquire a number of I-20’s. Do not throw any of them away, rather keep old ones in a safe place.</p>
