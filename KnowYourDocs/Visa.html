<div class="accordion">What is a Visa?</div>

<div class="accordion_content">
<p class="rtejustify">A visa is a document issued by the U.S. government, usually at an embassy or consulate outside of the United States. This allows you to present yourself at the Port of Entry and request to be let in.&nbsp; The important thing to remember about your visa is that this is the only immigration document that is OK to expire while you’re here in the U.S.&nbsp; Think of it as a key to get into the country – you need this “key” to get into the U.S.&nbsp; However, if you are in the U.S. with an expired visa and you decide to travel outside the U.S., you will need to renew it in order to come back.</p>
